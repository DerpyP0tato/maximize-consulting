Prompt:
Design a modern, premium consulting website for Maximize Consulting, a boutique firm focused on automation, analytics, and technical strategy for small teams.

Brand & Tone
Business name: Maximize Consulting
Tagline: Automation, analytics, and technical strategy for small teams
Tone: confident, calm, execution-focused
Personality: credible, builder-minded, no fluff
Feels like a consultant who ships systems, not slide decks

Visual Style
Modern, clean, tech-forward
Dark mode default with optional light mode
High-contrast typography
Subtle gradients, glass/blur accents
Premium consulting aesthetic (Stripe / Linear vibes)

Motion & Animations (VERY IMPORTANT)
Smooth scroll-triggered animations
Fade + slide-up transitions for sections
Staggered reveal for cards, bullets, and steps
Buttons with micro-interactions (hover glow, slight scale, arrow slide)
Sticky navbar with scroll-based transparency
Animated section dividers (gradient lines or blur effects)
Motion should feel polished and intentional, not flashy
Respect reduced-motion preferences
